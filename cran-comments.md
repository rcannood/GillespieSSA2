A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating large 
systems with Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ('SSA'). 
This package is the spiritual successor to the GillespieSSA package 
originally written by Mario Pineda-Krch. Benefits of this package
include major speed improvements (>100x), easier to understand documentation,
and many unit tests that try to ensure the package works as intended.
