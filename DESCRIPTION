Description: A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating large systems with 
  Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ('SSA'). It is the spiritual successor of 
  'GillespieSSA', but written entirely in 'Rcpp' with large scale systems in mind, to make
  it blazingly fast. The SSA methods currently implemented are: Exact, Explicit
  tau-leaping ('ETL'), and the Binomial tau-leaping ('BTL').
