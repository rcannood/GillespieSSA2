Description: A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating large systems with 
  Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ('SSA'). It is conceptually based on 
  'GillespieSSA', but rewritten entirely in 'Rcpp' with large scale systems in mind to make
  it blazingly fast. The 'SSA' methods currently implemented are: Direct, Explicit
  tau-leaping ('ETL'), and the Binomial tau-leaping ('BTL').
