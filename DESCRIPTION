Description: A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for
    simulating large systems with Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation
    Algorithm ('SSA').  This package is the spiritual successor to the
    'GillespieSSA' package originally written by Mario Pineda-Krch.
    Benefits of this package include major speed improvements (>100x),
    easier to understand documentation, and many unit tests that try to
    ensure the package works as intended. Cannoodt and Saelens et al. (2020)
