# `fastgssa`: Gillespie’s Stochastic Simulation Algorithm for impatient people.

**fastgssa** is a fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating
large systems with Gillespie’s Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). It
is conceptually based on
[GillespieSSA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GillespieSSA/index.html),
but rewritten entirely in Rcpp with large scale systems in mind to make
it blazingly fast. The SSA methods currently implemented are: Direct,
Explicit tau-leaping (ETL), and the Binomial tau-leaping (BTL).

## Install

You can install the development version of fastgssa from GitHub with

``` r
devtools::install_github("dynverse/fastgssa", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Examples

To get started, have a look at one of the vignettes:

  - [Preparing a run](vignettes/preparing_a_run.md):
    `vignette("preparing_a_run", package = "fastgssa")`.

### Recent changes in fastgssa 0.2.0 (unreleased)

Complete rewrite of the package:

  - The main SSA function and all SSA methods have been implemented in
    Rcpp.
  - User-defined propensity functions get compiled to Rcpp at runtime.
  - All SSA methods now assume the state-change matrix `nu` to be
    sparse.

### Recent changes in fastgssa 0.1.1 (05-01-2018)

  - MINOR CHANGE: Added automated testing by travis.
  - MINOR CHANGE: Fixes to documentation.
  - MINOR CHANGE: Also output propensities.
